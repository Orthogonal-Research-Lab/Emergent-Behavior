## Emergent Behavior in _C. elegans_ and other organisms  

Various proposals to the study of emergent behavior, or the behaviors that are generated by a connectome under construction.

1) connectome model in embryogenesis. Subset of connectome neurons are alive at time x, assume conservation of connectivity and 
ion channel function across development. 

* DevoWorm's [Embryogenetic _C. elegans_ connectome dataset](https://github.com/devoworm/embryogenetic-connectome) is an intersection of gap junction and electrochemically-defined relationships.

* gene expression data can be added to refine the models of ion channel activity.

2) antecedent behaviors (such as [chemotaxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis) or [phototaxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototaxis)).

3) stochastic movements that range from goal-directed to quasi-goal-directed.
